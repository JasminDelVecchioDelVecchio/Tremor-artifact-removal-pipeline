Matlab code for the paper "Pallidal Recordings in Chronically Implanted Dystonic Patients: Mitigation of Tremor-Related Artifacts" by Jasmin Del Vecchio Del Vecchio, Ibrahem Hanafi, Nicol√≥ Gabriele Pozzi, Philipp Capetian, Ioannis U. Isaias, Stefan Haufe, and Chiara Palmisano.

A multiple regression method is used to clean local field potentials (LFP) from head-tremor-related artifacts in a set of dystonic patients implanted with the Percept PC device (Medtronic, PLC). Tremor dynamics were recorded with a head-mounted inertial sensor (IMU: inertial measurement unit). Multiple time-lagged copies of the IMU signal are regressed out of the LFP to remove tremor artifact contribution. 

The authors would be grateful if published reports of research using this code (or a modified version, maintaining a significant portion of the original code) would cite the following article: Del Vecchio Del Vecchio, J.; Hanafi, I.; Pozzi, N.G.; Capetian, P.; Isaias, I.U.; Haufe, S.; Palmisano, C.
