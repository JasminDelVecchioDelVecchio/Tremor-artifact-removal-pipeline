Matlab code for the paper "Pallidal Recordings in Chronically Implanted Dystonic Patients: Mitigation of Tremor-Related Artifacts" by Jasmin Del Vecchio Del Vecchio,Ibrahem Hanafi, Nicol√≥ Gabriele Pozzi, Philipp Capetian, Ioannis U. Isaias, Stefan Haufe, andChiara Palmisano.

A multiple regression method is used to clean local field potentials (LFP) from head-tremor related artifact in a set of dystonic patients implanted with the Percept PC device (Medtronic, PLC).
